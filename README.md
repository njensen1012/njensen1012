- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @njensen1012
So, I'm about to turn 41 and I recently decided that I'd like to become a developer.
I've always enjoyed coding but it was VBA and SQL, simple stuff. 
I started taking a full stack developer program on Coursera... wow that was a Hell of a rabbit hole I fell into. 
Any advice, corrections, anything.. feel free to comment

Thanks for reading!
